# RAG Created from Scratch

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **simple implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** built from scratch for learning and experimentation purposes.

The goal of this notebook is to understand the core concepts behind RAG, including:
- Document retrieval
- Context augmentation
- Generating responses using retrieved information

## Files in the Repository
- `Rag created from Scratch.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing the complete implementation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLP concepts (Retrieval + Generation)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>


2. Open the notebook:
- jupyter notebook

3. Run the cells step by step to understand the workflow.

Purpose
This project is created for learning and practice to understand how RAG systems work internally.
